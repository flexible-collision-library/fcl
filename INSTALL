Dependencies:
============

 - libccd (available at http://libccd.danfis.cz/)
 - octomap (optional dependency, available at http://octomap.github.com)

libccd is the only mandatory dependency. If octomap is not found,
collision detection with octrees will not be possible.

For installation, CMake will also be needed (http://cmake.org).

Install:
=======

* Linux / Mac OS:
  The CMakeLists.txt can be used to generate makefiles; For example, one may use operations such as:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -jN # N is the maximum number of parallel compile jobs
  
Once the compilation is finished,
  make install
will install the project. To specify the installation prefix,
pass the parameter -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix/ to the "cmake .." command above.


* Visual Studio:
  The CMakeLists.txt can be used to generate a Visual Studio project, using the cmake build tool.
