        Separated        Intersecting       Single overlap    Multiple overlap

  Separated:        A single, well-defined pair of witness points to the
                    positive signed distance.
  Intersecting:     A single, well-defined pair of witness points to the
                    negative signed distance.
  Single overlap:   The capsule center lines intersect so there is no unique
                    witness pair to the negative signed distance.
  Multiple overlap: The capsule center lines overlap over an interval, so there
                    is no unique witness pair to the negative signed distance.

  We prevent the transforms from being "boring" by expressing the configuration
  above in a test frame T, but then evaluate the test in frame F, such that X_FT
  is arbitrarily ugly.
